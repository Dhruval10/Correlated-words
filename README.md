# Correlated-words
This project was submitted as a part of Software Group Project. Made in python this is actually an algorithm developed by us to find correlated words in a document. This algorithm doesnâ€™t give you synonyms but rather gives you the words which are correlated to each other based on their occurrences in the document.
